"Territory (bounded, by band)","About a quarter of the maps in ethnographic publications represent territorial relations, or “traditional territories”.  Often these maps show village sites with a territorial boundary being marked around watershed and island-scapes in close proximity to the village.  These territories are variously attributed as belonging to villages, bands, tribes, or cultural groups, according to the ethnographers own accounting of (or assumptions about) political organization.  These maps at times make sweeping generalization about land tenures and often miss critical inter-village ties and economic relations.  "

"Territory (no boundaries, by band)",There is a tradition in the ethnographic literature of of suggesting an territorial area of bands or tribes without making a catographic commitment to particular boundary lines.

Language Areas (w/ Boundaries),"Maps showing the area a langauge is primarly spoken is a significant  aanthropological mapping tradition. We found about twelve percent of the maps record follow this. Some scholars like Wayne Suttles have taken pains to point out that language and political identity are not the same thing, though one is often taken as a proxy for the other."
Language Areas (no Boundaries),There is a tradition of drawing language areas without making a catographic commitment to a particular set of boundary lines for where the langauge is spoken.
Culture Area Traits,"Culture area maps are about seven percent of the sources reviewed and are frequently reproduced in works not specifically on the Salish. The concept of “Culture Areas” developed in the 19th century following the idea that people within a certain geography who share a relatively homogeneous set of cultural practices or “culture traits” can be classified or grouped together, and that the distribution of these ‘cultural traits’ across a region can say something of the common histories and connections between areas.  Though organizing and classifying communities based on the culture area concept has been widely challenged, such schemes continue to percolate in the anthropological imagination."
Movement and Ties,"Some ethnographic maps have taken innovative approaches to representing social, economic, political and cultural relations cartographically.  Many of these maps have the potential to complicate more conventiional (and simplistic) map representations."
Village Sites,"A few ethnographers maps have  focused  on more human or visual scale of space, showing plans of reserves and village life. "
Place Names (Salishan lang),"Maps of indigenous place names are an important contribution of anthropologists’ maps, with careful documentation going back to at least the 1850s with George Gibb’s work on the Boundary Commission.  In spite of numerous errors and omissions, these maps continue to be highly valued by community members who are actively working on language revitalization and cultural revitalization. They are have also been central in anchoring land claims disputes in a deep local sense of place. "
Use and Occupancy Mapping,"Since the land use and occupancy mapping projects conducted in the Canadian north in the 1970s, this kind of map has come to powerfully represent or demonstrate the nature and extent of indigenous land and resource rights through documenting personal experiences of where rights have been exercised and land-based cultural knowledge and traditions."
Fishing Sites,"Anthropologists have attending to fishing practices in the Coast Salish world extensively in ethnographic descriptions, but surprisingly few maps have accompanied these works.  See 'Use and Occupancy Mapping' for more maps that deal with fishing."
Archaeological Landscapes,"Ethnographers have sometimes drawn out the presence of archaeological sites into maps of Coast Salish cultural landscapes.  This category by no way represents an exhaustive review of archaeological sites in the Coast Salish world.  These are by-in-large contained in archaeological monographs and in the databases stored by First Nations, Tribal, Provincial and State governments.  Locations of all but very well-know archaeological sites have been kept secret to protect sites from looting or desecration."
Historic Treaties,"Historic treaties in both Washington State and British Columbia have provided important analytical backdrop for anthropological writing.  Duff's map of the treaties signed at Fort Victoria in the 1850s is notable, as his analysis in the paper this map accompanies suggests that the colonial administrators marely knew the political and geographic extent of those treaties, making the treaty areas possibly impossible to accurately map.  The Washington State treaties were more reliably geographically defined."
Indian Reserves (generalized),The cadastral boundaries of Indian Reserves and Reservations are frequently represented by ethnographers in providing context for the lands and lives of Coast Salish peoples.
